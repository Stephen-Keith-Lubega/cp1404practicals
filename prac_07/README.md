# Practical 07

Repository for CP1404 practical work by STEPHEN KEITH LUBEGA

## About This Repository

This repository contains my practical work for CP1404 Programming II.

## Main Lessons in Clean Code

- Use meaningful variable names that clearly describe their purpose
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle - each function should do one thing
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by using functions for repeated logic
